Industry 4.0

o Customers want individual products

o These should be situation-related, varied & immediately available

o Added value and additional services become clear competitive advantages.

o Mass products are out - individual products are the future.

o Bought today and already obsolete tomorrow (example smartphone).

o New business models are shaking up entire industries: Facebook is the world's 
largest media company - without its own content; Uber transports passengers -
without its own vehicles and Airbnb is a kind of hotel chain - without its own houses. 
Automakers have huge software departments.

o Purchases are made internationally. Whoever offers the best price, the best quality

 and the best service wins. And every bad rating on the Internet damages the image.

o You only pay for what you need (pay per us).

What are our challenges?

What does...

o ... the learning form of the future? o ... the consumer of the future?

o ... the artist of the future? O ... the performance of the future? O ... the chamber play of the future? O ... the film and play of the future?

-> What are future topics for the SMP program?
